## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability in our project, please report it by emailing us at [support@scalar.com](mailto:support@scalar.com).

- **Response Time**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report and provide regular updates on the status of the vulnerability.

- **Process**: Once a vulnerability is reported:
  - We will triage the report and determine the severity and impact.
  - If the vulnerability is accepted, we will work on a patch and communicate an expected timeline for a fix.
  - If the vulnerability is declined, we will provide an explanation of our decision.

We greatly appreciate your efforts to improve the security of our project and will credit responsible disclosures appropriately.

Thank you for your contribution!
