# AsyncAPI Specification

We're in the process of adding [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/) support.

You can already load AsyncAPI documents. The rendering is very limited, though:

```js
Scalar.createApiReference('#app', {
  url: '/asyncapi.json'
})
```

The process is tracked on GitHub in [issue #7080](https://github.com/scalar/scalar/issues/7080). You can subscribe to the issue to receive updates.
