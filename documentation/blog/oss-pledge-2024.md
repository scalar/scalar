# Scalar Joins the Open-Source Pledge

## Sep 1st, 2024

What is OSS Pledge?

You can read more about it [here](https://osspledge.com/), but in short, it's paying Open Source maintainers. The minimum to participate is $2,000 per full-time employed developer per year.

When we met Chad Whitacre at the Open-Source Summit in Seattle earlier this year, we instantly bonded over all things open-source! He also told me the very early stages of the Open-Source Pledge that Sentry was starting and I couldn't have been more excited about joining it.
