# Markdown

You can use Markdown in various places, for example in `info.description`, in your tag descriptions, in your operation
descriptions, in your parameter descriptions and in a lot of other places. We’re using GitHub-flavored Markdown.
What’s working here, is probably also working in the API reference:

- bullet lists, numbered lists
- _italic_, **bold**, ~~striked~~ text
- accordions
- links
- tables
- images
- …

[Have a look at our OpenAPI example specification](https://github.com/scalar/scalar/blob/main/packages/galaxy/src/specifications/3.1.yaml)
to see more examples.

> Note: Not everything is supported in all places. For example, you can use images in most places, but not in parameter
> descriptions.
