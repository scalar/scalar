# C++

> [!NOTE]
> The C++ target is experimental.

Add `cpp` under `targets` to generate a C++ SDK package.

```json
{
  "targets": {
    "cpp": {
      "destinations": {
        "production": {
          "repo": "acme/acme-cpp"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

C++ has no package registry the generator publishes to, so this target generates the library and its CI workflow but no publishing workflow. Distribute the build artifacts from your GitHub release.

## destinations

**Type:** `object`

Per-target GitHub destinations for pushing generated output.

### production

**Type:** `object`

Primary published-output repository for this target. Configuring it is what gives the target generated GitHub Actions at all: it turns on the CI workflow, the release-please configuration, and the versioning policy. The release workflow that uploads at release time is added on top of those only when `publish` enables a registry that needs one — a tag-served ecosystem publishes from the platform-created tag alone. A target with no production destination is still generated, but emits no workflows, which is what local and preview generation wants.

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `repo` | `string` | ✅ | GitHub repository in `owner/name` form that generated output for this target is pushed to. An `owner/name#branch` suffix is tolerated and supplies the default branch when `branch` does not, but prefer setting `branch` on its own: not every target strips the suffix back off when it writes the repository URL into published package metadata. |
| `branch` | `string` |  | Default branch of the destination repository, and the base that release PRs are opened against. Generated output itself is always pushed to the fixed `scalar-generated` branch, which the platform merges with custom code on `scalar-next`; the release PR is raised from `scalar-next` against the branch named here, so merging it is the promotion. The branch is resolved by trying this value, then a `#branch` suffix on `repo`, then `main`, skipping any candidate that is not a safe git ref — the name is interpolated into generated workflow YAML, so an unsafe one is passed over rather than emitted, and an unsafe value here does not mask a usable suffix. |

## generatorVersion

**Type:** `string`

Version of the Scalar SDK Generator used to generate this target's SDK, overriding the top-level generatorVersion.

## skip

**Type:** `boolean`

When true, the target is not generated.

## readmeTitle

**Type:** `string`

Heading of this target's generated README, overriding the SDK-wide `readme.title`. Free-form prose, so it carries no pattern and a renderer has to emit it as escaped text rather than as markdown.

## promotion

**Type:** `"automatic" | "manual"`

When a successful build's generated output reaches this target's production destination. `automatic`, the default, pushes every build, which opens a release pull request. `manual` holds each build at the staging playground until it is promoted explicitly, so reaching production is a deliberate act rather than a consequence of building.

This governs when the push happens, never what is generated: a `manual` target still emits the GitHub Actions, release-please configuration and versioning policy that `destinations.production` turns on, so a promoted build behaves exactly like an automatic one. A target declaring no production destination pushes nowhere either way, and is unaffected.

**Default:** `"automatic"`
