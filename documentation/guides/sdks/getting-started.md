# Getting Started
This guide will help you get started with generating world-class SDKs on scalar.com in several languages: TypeScript, Python, Golang & more powered by [Speakeasy](https://speakeasy.com).


Make sure you have created a Scalar Account & are logged in ([see create account guide](/scalar/scalar-registry/getting-started#create-your-scalar-account))

## Generating your first SDK
From the [dashboard](https://dashboard.scalar.com) left-most sidebar under Products > SDKs, then click Create new SDK.

#### Import OpenAPI Document (Optional) 
If you don't already have an OpenAPI document on our registry, you can import it right in the modal.

Select as many SDKs as you would like, or just one language to start. Once you click "Continue" we will begin generating your SDKs.

Once created, you will get redirected to the SDK Overview page where you can:
- Configure your SDK settings
- Add our GitHub Integration
- Downlad the SDK Client
