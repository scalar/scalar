# GitHub Sync

Scalar GitHub Sync allows you to automatically publish your markdown files as a beautiful documentation website.

## Getting started

The following guide takes you from zero to deployed documentation in just a few minutes ‚ú®

### Set up docs your repository

Use your existing [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository, or create a new one from our [template repository](https://github.com/scalar/starter). If you're using the template repository, you can skip to "Configuration".

#### Add some content

If you have a few Markdown files already, that‚Äôs awesome. Otherwise, just create a new `docs` folder and add at least one [Markdown file](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax):

```bash
# Create a docs/ folder
mkdir docs

# Create an example file
echo "# Hello World" > docs/introduction.md
```

That should be enough to prepare your content. Time to configure your project, let‚Äôs create a Scalar configuration file:

```bash
touch scalar.config.json
```

#### Configuration

Add the content below to your `scalar.config.json` file. Note: You want to modify the subdomain. The one in the example is already taken. üòâ Your docs site will be available at `https://<subdomain>.apidocumentation.com`.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://cdn.scalar.com/schema/scalar-config.json",
  "subdomain": "my-awesome-documentation",
  "guides": [
    {
      "name": "My awesome documentation",
      "sidebar": [
        {
          "path": "docs/introduction.md",
          "type": "page"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "references": []
}
```

Make sure to commit and push the changes to your repository.

### Connect your repository to Scalar

Create a free Scalar account here: https://dashboard.scalar.com/register

Once signed in, click on ‚ÄúLink GitHub Account‚Äù. You‚Äôll be redirected to GitHub, where you can connect your account. After connecting your account, you‚Äôll be redirected back to Scalar.

Find your repository and click on ‚ÄúLink Repository‚Äù.

### Publish changes

To publish your site for the first time, click on ‚ÄúPublish". Now sit back and relax, your documentation is being generated for you and deployed to our super fast edge servers, this will take a few minutes.

Once done, you‚Äôll see "Deployment Live" in the right hand column and a link to your new documentation site. Congratulations, you‚Äôve made it!

## Advanced configuration

There‚Äôs definitely more to configure. Here are some more options for you:

### Add an OpenAPI reference

Add an OpenAPI/Swagger file to your configuration file:

```json
{
  "references": [
    {
      "name": "API Reference",
      "path": "docs/openapi.yaml"
    }
  ]
}
```

That‚Äôs it. :) The next time your documentation is published, it‚Äôll include a super cool API reference.

### Deploy on merge

You can use the UI on https://dashboard.scalar.com or the Scalar configuration file to enable _Publish on Merge_, which ‚Äì you might have guessed it ‚Äî publishes your documentation when a branch is merged into the default branch (`main`):

```json
{
  "publishOnMerge": true
}
```

### Use a custom theme

You don‚Äôt like how the documentation looks? Just try a few of our themes:

```json
{
  "theme": "purple"
}
```

Available themes:

- `alternate`
- `default`
- `moon`
- `purple`
- `solarized`
- `bluePlanet`
- `deepSpace`
- `saturn`
- `kepler`
- `mars`

### Use a custom domain

Okay, this requires a subscription, but it‚Äôs pretty neat: You can add a custom domain to stay fully on brand and we‚Äôll make sure to deploy your documentation, get a SSL certificate and all that.

```json
{
  "customDomain": "docs.example.com"
}
```

Head to your domain name provider (Namecheap, GoDaddy, ‚Ä¶) and add the following DNS records to the domain name you‚Äôd like to publish to:

| Type    | Host                                         | Value            |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `CNAME` | `docs` (if the domain is `docs.example.com`) | `dns.scalar.com` |
