# Introduction

Youâ€™re working with APIs? Thatâ€™s great, weâ€™re here to make your life easier. Weâ€™re building the modern open-source developer experience platform for your APIs.

## Scalar Docs

[Scalar Docs](/scalar/introduction) is our managed platform for whipping up and publishing documentation sites and API references.

Weâ€™ve made it super easy to work together, and thereâ€™s an awesome free plan to get started. Plus, it plays nice with your existing setup. How cool is that? [Check out how it integrates with GitHub](/scalar/scalar-docs/markdown-sync).

Hop over to <https://docs.scalar.com> and take it for a spin. You donâ€™t even need an account to play with it.

## Open-source

Weâ€™ve also got some seriously cool open-source projects on GitHub! Go ahead, dive in and play around. These tools are here to make your life easier. Whether youâ€™re an API pro or just getting started, I bet thereâ€™s something here for you:
