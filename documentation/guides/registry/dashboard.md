# Dashboard
This guide will help you interact with our registry with our dashboard on scalar.com, which can be done alongside our [CLI](/scalar/scalar-cli/getting-started).

Make sure you have created a Scalar Account & are logged in ([see create account guide](/scalar/scalar-registry/getting-started#create-your-scalar-account))

## Add an OpenAPI Document
Now let's add an OpenAPI document to the registry âœ¨

From the dashboard click Import API from the right hand pane, or navigate to registry in the sidebar under Products then click Create new API

![Scalar Import OpenAPI Document Modal](https://api.scalar.com/cdn/images/UCkGjASrXpR8OxgWEj32i/WnMVG8hrR_f-6t-lOtDYb.png "Scalar Import OpenAPI Document")

You can upload any version of OpenAPI (even Swagger) or a Postman Collection!

Awesome, now your OpenAPI Document is in the Scalar Registry under your companies namespace!


## Update an OpenAPI Document
You can use our [OpenAPI Editor](https://editor.scalar.com) to make changes to your OpenAPI Document, or click Edit Document from the [Registry Page](https://dashboard.scalar.com/registry).

## Delete an OpenAPI Document
You can delete an OpenAPI document from the Registry > Overview page, however please consider the downstream effects of which products are depending on that OpenAPI document before deleting that resource.
