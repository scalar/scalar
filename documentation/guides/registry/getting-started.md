# Getting Started
Reading this guide helps you to get started with Scalar Registry for managing & versioning OpenAPI Documents, JSON Schema, Spectral Rules as your source of truth with a deep Git integration.

## Create your Scalar Account
To first access the Scalar Registry you need to [create an account](https://dashboard.scalar.com/register) or [sign in](https://dashboard.scalar.com/login).

![Scalar Dashboard](https://api.scalar.com/cdn/images/UCkGjASrXpR8OxgWEj32i/t8MUp4KrYwCT9WKYuVnUu.png "Scalar Dashboard")

Once authenticated you will see your dashboard, you have two options to interface with the Scalar Registry:
- The Scalar [dashboard](/scalar/scalar-registry/dashboard)
- The Scalar [CLI](/scalar/scalar-registry/cli)
- Our [GitHub Workflows](/scalar/scalar-registry/github-workflows)

## So... Why a Registry?
Managing OpenAPI can be difficult; is the source-of-truth: design, implementation, Git, cloud? How do you manage versions and access, also how do downstream consumers of your API interact with it? Does it need to be private?

Who is going to update the docs when our API has new endpoints or examples?

Scalar handles all this and makes it incredibly easy to get to the exciting stuff! Once a document is in the Scalar Registry we can:

### Create Docs
World Class API Docs with just a few clicks, all managed by Scalars registry automagically from your OpenAPI document changes.

### Create SDKs
World Class SDKs with just a few clicks, all managed by Scalars registry automagically from your OpenAPI document changes.

and so much more!

All of this with just a couple clicks or a few API requests! You handle making your API great, and we will handle the rest of the tooling. OpenAPI first.
