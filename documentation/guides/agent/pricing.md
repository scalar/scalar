# Agent Scalar Pricing

Agent Scalar offers flexible pricing to fit your needs, from free local development to scalable production deployments.

## Free Tier

Agent Scalar works out of the box on `localhost` with no configuration required. This includes:

- 10 free messages per session
- Full chat functionality

This is perfect for testing and exploring the feature before committing to production use.

| ---------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Scalar Pro | $24/month per user | 1,000 messages    | $0.02 per message   |
