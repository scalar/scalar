## What is SSO/SAML?

With **SSO (Single Sign-On)**, users only need to create and use one main account to access multiple applications, instead of making separate accounts and logging in to each app individually.

**SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)** is a technical standard used to implement SSO. It defines the protocol and data format that enables your identity provider and applications to securely communicate authentication and authorization information.
