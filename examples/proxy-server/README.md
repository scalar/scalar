[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/1135330207960678410?style=flat&color=5865F2)](https://discord.gg/scalar)

The Scalar Proxy redirects requests to another server to avoid CORS issues. Itâ€™s made to work well with the Scalar API Client.

## Features

- Full CORS support with customizable origins
- Handles HTTP redirects while preserving headers
- Supports HTTPS with TLS
- Request logging with method and target URL
- Health check endpoint at `/ping`
- Configurable port via environment variable
- Preserves original request headers and body
- Forwards all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
- Zero external dependencies - uses only Go standard library
