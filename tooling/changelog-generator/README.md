# @scalar-internal/changelog-generator

Custom changelog generator for Scalar packages that creates cleaner, more readable changelogs.

## Features

- **No commit hashes**: Changelogs only show PR links, not commit hashes
- **No "Thanks" messages**: Cleaner format without contributor attribution in changelog
- **Better structure**: Package changes appear first, followed by dependency updates
- **Dependency details**: Each dependency update shows its individual changes with PR links
