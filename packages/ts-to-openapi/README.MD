This an extremely early version of a typescript type to OpenAPI document converter. The goal is to take types that one
would normally use when developing an API and convert them to an OpenAPI document which will then be used to power the
standalone Scalar API References.

This package is not meant to be used directly, but will be the core technology behind framework specific integrations
starting with Next.js.
