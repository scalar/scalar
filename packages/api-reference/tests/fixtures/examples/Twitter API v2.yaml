  - name: Tweet Lookup
    description: >-
      These endpoints return details about Tweets specified by the requested
      IDs.


      For full details, see the [API
      reference](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/lookup/api-reference)
      for these endpoints.
  - name: User Lookup
    description: >-
      These endpoints return details about Twitter users specified by the
      requested IDs or usernames.


      For full details, see the [API
      reference](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/users/lookup/api-reference)
      for these endpoints.
  - name: Follows
    description: >-
      The follows lookup endpoints enable you to explore and analyze the
      relationships between users, which is sometimes called network analysis.
      This set of endpoints also enables you to follow or unfollow accounts on
      behalf of an authenticated user.
  - name: Blocks
    description: >-
      Blocking users is a core feature of security on Twitter.  Using the
      endpoints in the manage blocks endpoint group, you can build safer
      experiences for Twitter users or block users programmatically based on
      previous engagements. You can also unblock users after a given period of
      time based on the criteria that you determine. You can block a specified
      user on behalf of an authenticating user or unblock a user with these
      endpoints.
  - name: List
    description: >-
      Twitter Lists allows users to customize, organize and prioritize the
      Tweets they see in their timeline. With the Lists endpoints, you can build
      solutions that enable people to curate and organize Tweets based on
      preferences, interests, groups, or topics.

  - name: Manage Tweets
    description: >-
      Creating and deleting Tweets using the API is essential for engaging with
      the public conversation and ensuring a safer Twitter experience. 


      We have two available methods for manage Tweets, POST and DELETE. The POST
      method lets you post polls, quote Tweets, Tweet with reply settings, and
      Tweet to Super Followers in addition to other features. Likewise, the
      DELETE method allows you to delete a specific Tweet.
  - name: Mutes
    description: >-
      Muting an account allows you to remove an account's Tweets from your
      timeline without unfollowing or blocking that account. Muted accounts will
      not know that you've muted them and you can unmute them at any time. With
      manage mutes endpoints, developers can create safer experiences for people
      on Twitter. One example of how to build with manage mutes is an
      application that allows you to mute accounts that might Tweet about
      specific topics for a specified length of time. With the mutes lookup
      endpoint, you can see who you or an authenticated user has muted. This can
      be useful to determine how you interact with the muted accounts.
  - name: Quote Tweets
    description: >-
      The user Tweet and user mention timeline endpoints provide access to the
      most recent Tweets published by a specific Twitter user, as well as the
      most recent Tweets mentioning a specific Twitter user.
  - name: Hide Replies
    description: >-
      Provides the ability to hide or unhide replies to Tweets.


      For full details, see the [API
      reference](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/hide-replies/api-reference/put-tweets-id-hidden)
      for this endpoint.
  - name: Search Tweets
    description: >-
      Search for public Tweets created in the last 7 days, or the complete
      history of public Tweets.
  - name: Tweet Counts
    description: >-
      Search for public Tweets created in the last 7 days, or the complete
      history of public Tweets.
  - name: Filtered Stream
    description: >-
      The filtered stream endpoint allows developers to filter the real-time
      stream of public Tweets. You will need to set up rules in order to receive
      Tweets from the streaming endpoint.


      Please note streaming responses are currently not supported in Postman.
      Use the Stream request to help form your request, then click on Code >
      cURL. Copy the cURL command and paste in terminal to view the response.
  - name: Sampled Stream
    description: >-
      The sampled stream endpoint allows developers to stream, in real-time,
      roughly a 1% sample of all public Tweets. 


      Please note streaming responses are currently not supported in Postman.
      Use the Stream request to help form your request, then click on Code >
      cURL. Copy the cURL command and paste in terminal to view the response.
  - name: Spaces
  - name: Spaces > Spaces lookup
    description: >-
      Endpoints you can call if you know the ID of a Space, the ID of its
      creator, or the ID of users whose followings may be hosting Spaces.
  - name: Spaces > Search Spaces
    description: Endpoints to search live and upcoming Spaces by keyword.
  - name: Batch Compliance
  - name: Likes
    description: >-
      Liking Tweets is a core functionality of using Twitter. Now you can use v2
      of the API to like and unlike Tweets.


      The manage Likes endpoints enable you to like or unlike a specified Tweet
      on behalf of an authenticated account. For this endpoint group, there are
      two methods available POST and DELETE. The POST method allows you to like
      a Tweet, and the DELETE method will enable you to unlike a Tweet.


      Since you are making requests on behalf of an account, you must
      authenticate these endpoints with OAuth 1.0a User Context and use
      associated Access Tokens. You can generate the credentials needed using
      the 3-legged OAuth flow. There is a rate limit of 50 requests per 15
      minutes per endpoint with both endpoints, and a daily limit of 1000 likes
      and unlikes per day. Both the POST and DELETE methods share the daily rate
      limit.

                          on combatting racial inequality.


                          “In order for a company to be successful at inclusion
                          and diversity, the work has to be embedded in all
                          aspects. In pay equity, in procurement, in supplier
                          diversity.”
