# @scalar/config

Defining types and functions for validating Scalar configuration files, `scalar.config.json`, to be used with the Scalar app.

This package is intended to be used with the [`@scalar/cli`](../cli/README.md) using the `check` command.

## Development

We are using [TypeBox](https://github.com/sinclairzx81/typebox) for JSON schema validation.
