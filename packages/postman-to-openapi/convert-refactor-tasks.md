- Note: All changes should be accompanied by tests that cover new behavior and guard against regressions.
- [x] Tighten `extractTags` typing (no `any`); ensure folder items are strongly typed and avoid shared mutation.
- [x] Add safe parsing for string input with a clear, typed error message when JSON is invalid.
- [x] Validate `collection.info` early; fail with a descriptive error if `info` or `name` is missing.
- [x] Introduce a small helper to initialize and merge `openapi.components`/`securitySchemes` instead of repeating inline merges.
- [x] Review path merge behavior after `normalizePath`: decide and enforce how to handle duplicate path+method collisions (overwrite vs error/log).
- [x] Extract the method-level cleanup (parameters, requestBody, description pruning) into a focused helper to simplify the final sweep.
- [ ] Revisit `removeUndefined`: scope cleanup to known optional fields to avoid full-document churn.
- [x] Clarify tag generation: document intent for nested folder tags (separator, deduplication); adjust implementation if needed.
- [x] Move requestBody defaulting (empty `text/plain`) closer to `processItem` so request body shaping is centralized.
- [x] Add targeted tests for edge cases: invalid JSON input, missing `info`, empty `item`, conflicting paths/verbs, auth-less collections, empty requestBody content handling.
- [x] Add a type guard for parsed collection input to ensure `info`, `item`, and `variable` shapes before continuing, avoiding unchecked object access.
- [x] Make `removeUndefined` generic and typed to return `T`, eliminating `any` and keeping the document shape intact through inference.
- [ ] Replace `Object.entries` loops that currently rely on implicit `any` with typed helpers (e.g., `mergePaths`, `mergeSecuritySchemes`) to preserve OpenAPI typings.
- [ ] Explicitly type internal helper functions in this file (e.g., `processTagItem`) and avoid implicit `any` in callback parameters.
- [ ] Ensure all merges use typed aliases for OpenAPI structures (e.g., `OpenAPIV3_1.PathsObject`, `SecuritySchemesObject`) to improve readability and editor help.
