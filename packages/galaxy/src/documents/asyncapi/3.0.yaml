    The Scalar Galaxy Events provides real-time notifications and event-driven capabilities for the Scalar Galaxy API. This AsyncAPI document complements the [REST API](https://galaxy.scalar.com) by enabling event-driven interactions.

    ## Event-Driven Features

    * Real-time Planet Updates: Get notified when planets are created, updated, or experience cosmic events
    * User Activity Streams: Track user signups, authentication events, and profile changes
    * Celestial Body Monitoring: Monitor changes to satellites, asteroids, and other celestial objects
    * System Notifications: Receive alerts about system maintenance, rate limits, and security events
