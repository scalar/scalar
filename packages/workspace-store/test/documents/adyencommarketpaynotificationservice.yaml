    This API is used for the classic integration. If you are just starting your implementation, refer to our [new integration guide](https://docs.adyen.com/marketplaces-and-platforms) instead.

    The Notification API sends notifications to the endpoints specified in a given subscription. 
    Subscriptions are managed through the Notification Configuration API. The API specifications listed here detail the format of each notification.

    For more information, refer to our [documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/marketplaces-and-platforms/classic/notifications).
