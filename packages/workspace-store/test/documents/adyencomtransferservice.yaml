    The Transfers API provides endpoints that you can use to get information about all your transactions, move funds within your balance platform or send funds from your balance platform to a [transfer instrument](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/legalentity/latest/post/transferInstruments).

    ## Authentication
    Your Adyen contact will provide your API credential and an API key. To connect to the API, add an `X-API-Key` header with the API key as the value, for example:

     ```
    curl
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
    ...
    ```

    Alternatively, you can use the username and password to connect to the API using basic authentication. For example:

    ```
    curl
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -U "ws@BalancePlatform.YOUR_BALANCE_PLATFORM":"YOUR_WS_PASSWORD" \
    ...
    ```
    ## Roles and permissions
    To use the Transfers API, you need an additional role for your API credential. Transfers must also be enabled for the source balance account. Your Adyen contact will set up the roles and permissions for you.
    ## Versioning
    The Transfers API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: "vXX", where XX is the version number.

    For example:
    ```
    https://balanceplatform-api-test.adyen.com/btl/v3/transfers
    ```
    ## Going live
    When going live, your Adyen contact will provide your API credential for the live environment. You can then use the username and password to send requests to `https://balanceplatform-api-live.adyen.com/btl/v3`.

        Starts a request to transfer funds to [balance accounts](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/balanceplatform/latest/post/balanceAccounts), [transfer instruments](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/legalentity/latest/post/transferInstruments), or third-party bank accounts. Adyen sends the outcome of the transfer request through webhooks.

        To use this endpoint, you need an additional role for your API credential and transfers must be enabled for the source balance account. Your Adyen contact will set these up for you.
