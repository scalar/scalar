  title: AWS Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authority
  description: <p>This is the <i>Amazon Web Services Private Certificate Authority API Reference</i>. It provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data types involved in creating and managing a private certificate authority (CA) for your organization.</p> <p>The documentation for each action shows the API request parameters and the JSON response. Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to access an API that is tailored to the programming language or platform that you prefer. For more information, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs">Amazon Web Services SDKs</a>.</p> <p>Each Amazon Web Services Private CA API operation has a quota that determines the number of times the operation can be called per second. Amazon Web Services Private CA throttles API requests at different rates depending on the operation. Throttling means that Amazon Web Services Private CA rejects an otherwise valid request because the request exceeds the operation's quota for the number of requests per second. When a request is throttled, Amazon Web Services Private CA returns a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/CommonErrors.html">ThrottlingException</a> error. Amazon Web Services Private CA does not guarantee a minimum request rate for APIs. </p> <p>To see an up-to-date list of your Amazon Web Services Private CA quotas, or to request a quota increase, log into your Amazon Web Services account and visit the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/">Service Quotas</a> console.</p>

      description: <p>Creates a root or subordinate private certificate authority (CA). You must specify the CA configuration, an optional configuration for Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) and/or a certificate revocation list (CRL), the CA type, and an optional idempotency token to avoid accidental creation of multiple CAs. The CA configuration specifies the name of the algorithm and key size to be used to create the CA private key, the type of signing algorithm that the CA uses, and X.500 subject information. The OCSP configuration can optionally specify a custom URL for the OCSP responder. The CRL configuration specifies the CRL expiration period in days (the validity period of the CRL), the Amazon S3 bucket that will contain the CRL, and a CNAME alias for the S3 bucket that is included in certificates issued by the CA. If successful, this action returns the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CA.</p> <note> <p>Both Amazon Web Services Private CA and the IAM principal must have permission to write to the S3 bucket that you specify.

You can also delete it if the CA has been created but you haven't yet imported the signed certificate into Amazon Web Services Private CA (that is, the status of the CA is <code>PENDING_CERTIFICATE</code>). </p> <p>When you successfully call <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteCertificateAuthority.html">DeleteCertificateAuthority</a>, the CA's status changes to <code>DELETED</code>.

By default, if you do not set the <code>PermanentDeletionTimeInDays</code> parameter, the CA remains restorable for 30 days. You can set the parameter from 7 to 30 days. The <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeCertificateAuthority.html">DescribeCertificateAuthority</a> action returns the time remaining in the restoration window of a private CA in the <code>DELETED</code> state.

Currently, you can specify 7 to 30 days. If you did not specify a <b>PermanentDeletionTimeInDays</b> value, by default you can restore the CA at any time in a 30 day period.

The status of a restored CA is set to its pre-deletion status when the <b>RestoreCertificateAuthority</b> action returns. To change its status to <code>ACTIVE</code>, call the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateCertificateAuthority.html">UpdateCertificateAuthority</a> action. If the private CA was in the <code>PENDING_CERTIFICATE</code> state at deletion, you must use the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/API_ImportCertificateAuthorityCertificate.html">ImportCertificateAuthorityCertificate</a> action to import a certificate authority into the private CA before it can be activated. You cannot restore a CA after the restoration period has ended.

      description: <p>Validity specifies the period of time during which a certificate is valid. Validity can be expressed as an explicit date and time when the validity of a certificate starts or expires, or as a span of time after issuance, stated in days, months, or years.

The required parameter <code>IssueCertificate</code>:<code>Validity</code> specifies the end of a certificate's validity period. The optional parameter <code>IssueCertificate</code>:<code>ValidityNotBefore</code> specifies a customized starting time for the validity period.</p>
