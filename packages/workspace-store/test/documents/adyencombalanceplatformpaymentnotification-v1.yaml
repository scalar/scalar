    The payment webhooks are deprecated. Use the [accounting webhooks](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/transfer-webhooks/latest/overview) instead.

    Adyen sends notifications through webhooks to inform your system about the creation of payment resources and money movements in your platform.

    You can use these webhooks to build your implementation. For example, you can use this information to update balances in your own dashboards or to keep track of incoming funds.

        Adyen sends this webhook when a payment authorisation, a refund, or a funds transfer has been initiated. This webhook only informs your server of requests. For the actual fund movements, you'll get the information from the subsequent outgoing or incoming transfer webhooks.

         To differentiate the requests, check the content of the webhook.

        * For payments, the webhook contains the authorisation result, information about the processing merchant, and shows a negative amount.

         * For refunds, the webhook contains to which payment instrument the funds will be refunded, and shows a positive amount.

        * For outgoing or incoming fund transfers, the webhook shows a positive or negative amount depending on the direction of the transfer, and only includes information about the balance account.
