/**
 * Describes a single header for HTTP responses and for individual parts in multipart representations; see the relevant Response Object and Encoding Object documentation for restrictions on which headers can be described.
 *
 * The Header Object follows the structure of the Parameter Object, including determining its serialization strategy based on whether schema or content is present, with the following changes:
 *
 *    - name MUST NOT be specified, it is given in the corresponding headers map.
 *    - in MUST NOT be specified, it is implicitly in header.
 *    - All traits that are affected by the location MUST be applicable to a location of header (for example, style). This means that allowEmptyValue and allowReserved MUST NOT be used, and style, if used, MUST be limited to "simple".
