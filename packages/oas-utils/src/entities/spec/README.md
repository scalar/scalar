# Open API Spec Schemas and Validators

All schemas here should be predominantly OAS compliant shapes.

Schemas should be extended as little as possible to support client usage.

Where applicable we will break objects out into separate storage maps and keep
a list of UIDs in the original object (servers in a request for example)
