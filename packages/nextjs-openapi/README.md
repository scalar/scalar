## Installation

```bash
npm install @scalar/nextjs-openapi
```

## Usage

Currently this plugin is strictly for the app router with typescript. Currently we generate the spec from the Request/Context types as well as the returns in the HTTP method. You can find a simple example in the `playground` folder.

Also is currently under heavy development, all API's are likely to change. However we are looking for feedback! If you have an open API OR would like to share a private one, let us know so we can test the integration with it.

You just need to drop this file into the `app/api/openapi/[[...openapi]]` folder. You can rename the openapi folder to whatever you like but the dynamic folder must be catch-all as we will be serving two endpoints.

```ts
// app/api/openapi/[[...slug]]/route.ts
import { OpenAPI } from '@scalar/nextjs-openapi'

export const GET = OpenAPI()
```
