# Writing Tests

You write tests that are clear, maintainable, and thorough. You optimize for readability and reliability. Tests should be easy to understand and cover both typical use cases and edge cases.

## Setup

* Use Vitest for most tests. Vitest is our primary testing framework.
*	No globals. Always explicitly import describe, it, and expect from vitest in every test file.
*	File naming conventions:
  * Unit/integration test files end with .test.ts.
  * Each test file matches the name of the file it tests. Example: If the code is in custom-function.ts, the test file should be named custom-function.test.ts.
  * The test file is located in the same folder as the file under test. This keeps code and tests closely related, improving discoverability and maintainability.
* Minimize mocking. Only mock when absolutely necessary. Prefer refactoring the code under test to make mocking unnecessary. Aim for simpler, pure functions that are easier to test without mocks.
* Every test file has a top-level describe().
  * The top-level describe() matches the file name under test. Example: describe('custom-function') for custom-function.test.ts.
	*	Inside this describe(), you can add nested describe() blocks if you're testing multiple functions or distinct features.
	* Deeper nesting is fine if it improves clarity.
	*	Use it() for individual tests.
	*	Keep descriptions concise and direct.
	*	Do not start with “should.”

    ❌ it('should generate a slug from the title')

## Testing Vue Components

* Don't rely on markup for assertions.
* Avoid testing the exact structure of the DOM unless necessary.
* Do not rely on Tailwind CSS classes in assertions.
* Focus on testing behavior, outputs, and user interactions instead of implementation details.

## Playwright Tests

* Use Playwright for limited end-to-end testing.
* Playwright tests live in /playwright/test/.
* Files end with .spec.ts.
* Example file: @local.spec.ts.
* Be selective. We intentionally limit the number of Playwright tests to avoid maintenance overhead.

## Style & Best Practices

* Clarity first. Write tests that are easy to read and understand, even for someone unfamiliar with the code.
* Think like a QA engineer.
  * Cover all important code paths.
	* Test both the happy path and error handling.
	* Add tests for edge cases and potential failure scenarios.
* Comments are welcome when they add value.
	* Use comments to explain why a test exists, not what it's doing.
	* Avoid repeating what the code already makes obvious.

## Example Test File Structure

```
/src
  /lib
    custom-lib.ts
    custom-lib.test.ts
```

```ts
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest'
import { generateSlug } from './custom-function'

describe('custom-lib', () => {
  describe('generateSlug', () => {
    it('generates a slug from the title', () => {
      const result = generateSlug('Hello World')
      expect(result).toBe('hello-world')
    })

    it('handles empty input gracefully', () => {
      const result = generateSlug('')
      expect(result).toBe('')
    })
  })
})
```
