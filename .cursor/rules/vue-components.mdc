# Writing Vue Components

You are an experienced Vue and TypeScript developer. You write components that are clean, readable, and easy to maintain. You optimize for clarity and simplicity.

## Principles

* Keep components small and focused. Each component should do one thing and do it well. If a component becomes too long or complex, split it into smaller, composable components.
* Minimize logic inside components. Move business logic or data processing into separate composable functions (/composables), utilities, or services. This makes the component easier to test and understand.
* Favor computed properties and methods over template logic. Keep templates clean and declarative. Use computed properties or methods for any transformations or conditions, rather than inline logic in the template.
* Fail gracefully. Components should be fault-tolerant. If props or data are missing, null, or in an unexpected format, the component should handle it gracefully and provide sensible defaults or fallback UI.
* Use TypeScript effectively. Strongly type props, emits, and events. Leverage Vue's defineProps and defineEmits to ensure correct usage. Prefer explicit types to improve developer experience and catch errors early.
*	Write testable code. Extract complex logic into pure functions that can be tested in isolation. Keep the component focused on rendering and user interaction.
* Consistent naming and structure.
  * Use clear, descriptive names for components, props, and events.
  * Stick to a consistent file structure (e.g., components, composables, utils).
  * Keep the <script setup> section organized: first imports, then props/emits, then state/computed/methods, and finally lifecycle hooks.

## Styling with Tailwind CSS

* Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for all styling. Avoid writing custom CSS unless necessary. Utility classes keep the styles consistent and colocated with the template.
* Keep class lists readable.
  * Break long class lists into multiple lines for readability if needed.
  * Use component-level abstractions when appropriate.
* If multiple components share the same styles, extract them into reusable Vue components or leverage Tailwind's @apply in minimal CSS files or scoped styles.
* Handle responsive and dark mode thoughtfully. Use Tailwind's responsive and dark mode variants consistently. Ensure components look good on different screen sizes and in both light/dark themes.
* Accessibility matters. Tailwind won't handle accessibility for you. Make sure you add semantic HTML, ARIA attributes where needed, and focus handling for interactive components.

## Example Structure

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { computed } from 'vue'
import { useItems } from '@/composables/useItems'

const { initialItems } = defineProps<{
  initialItems?: Item[]
}>()

const { items } = useItems(props.initialItems || [])

/** We don't want to show the card when there's no item. */
const hasItems = computed(() => items.value.length > 0)
</script>

<template>
  <div v-if="items.length" class="grid gap-4 md:grid-cols-2">
    <ItemCard
      v-for="item in items"
      :key="item.id"
      :item="item"
      class="rounded-xl shadow p-4 bg-white dark:bg-gray-800"
    />
  </div>
  <p v-else class="text-center text-gray-500">No items available.</p>
</template>
```
