            ### Playwright visual snapshot differences were detected.
            View the [Playwright report](${{ steps.artifact-upload.outputs.artifact-url }}) to review the visual differences.
            Inspect the changes and commit the updated snapshots if they are satisfactory.
            If a **snapshot-diff.png** is not provided, the snapshots are different sizes.
