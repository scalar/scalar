# Changelog

For a general overview of releases, see the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/scalar/scalar/releases) page.

## Version Management

This project uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage versioning and changelogs. Each package and integration maintains its own detailed changelog:

- **Packages**: See `packages/*/CHANGELOG.md` for individual package changelogs
- **Integrations**: See `integrations/*/CHANGELOG.md` for individual integration changelogs

These changelogs are automatically generated from changesets when releases are published.
